These are general rules that you should adhere to on every request:

- As you read thru files, try to spot areas where a refactor would help make the project cleaner, then suggest them in your end of task summary.
    Note the suggestion with "=== REFACTOR SUGGESTION === : ". This way I can see & decide if I should take your suggestion to refactor.
