# Task List Management and creation

Guidelines for creating and managing task lists in Tasks.md to track project progress.

Update the Tasks.md file with these guidelines:
Create new tasks using the below formatting and a brief description of the feature and its purpose.
Keep tasks in these 3 sections, move the tasks among these sections as they are worked on.
Create/manage subtasks only during in Progress, remove them when the parent task is done.
Add subtasks as needed to stay organized (no more than 5 per parent task).
