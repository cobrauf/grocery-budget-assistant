# Task List Management and creation

Guidelines for creating and managing task lists in Tasks.md to track project progress.

Update the Tasks.md file with these guidelines:
Increment the "Number of times.." line.
As the user make requests, decide whether the Tasks.md file should be updated.
Create new tasks using the below formatting and a brief description of the feature and its purpose.
Keep tasks in these 3 sections, tasks should move from Future to In progress to Completed.
Create/manage subtasks only during in Progress, remove them when the parent task is done.
Add subtasks as needed to stay organized (no more than 5 per parent task).
Check after each user request if any tasks have been completed and mark them (if subtask) or mark + move them (parent task).
