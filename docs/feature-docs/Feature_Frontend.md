Frontend Product Requirements Document (PRD)

1. Introduction
   This document outlines the frontend requirements for the retail application, based on the provided mockups. The primary goal is to create a user-friendly, performant, and visually customizable interface that allows users to easily search for products, filter results, and personalize their experience through themes.

2. Goals
   Implement a responsive and intuitive user interface across relevant devices (primarily mobile, based on mockups).

   Should be a SPA.

Enable users to efficiently browse and search for products.

Provide dynamic loading of search results for a smooth browsing experience.

Allow users to refine search results using filters via a modal interface.

Offer users the ability to quickly change the application's visual theme.

Ensure high performance and responsiveness, especially during search and scrolling.

3. User Stories / Features
   3.1 Theme Selection
   User Story: As a user, I want to be able to quickly change the visual theme (color scheme) of the application so that I can personalize my browsing experience.

Description: The application should offer a selection of predefined color themes (e.g., Light, Dark, potentially others like a high-contrast theme). Users should be able to select their preferred theme from a dedicated settings or profile section. The theme change should apply immediately across the application interface without requiring a reload or restart.

Requirements:

Implement a theme switching mechanism accessible from a user profile or settings screen.

Provide at least 3 themes: Light (default, similar to the mockup) and Dark, and Pastel.

Ensure all core UI components (headers, footers, buttons, text, backgrounds, product cards, modals) adapt to the selected theme.

Theme changes must be instant upon selection.

The user's theme preference should be saved locally (e.g., using localStorage or similar) so it persists across sessions.

3.2 Infinite Scrolling for Search Results
User Story: As a user viewing search results, I want more results to load automatically as I scroll down, so I don't have to click a "next page" button.

Description: On the search results page, when the user scrolls towards the end of the currently loaded list of results, the application should automatically fetch and display the next set of results. This provides a continuous browsing experience.

Requirements:

Implement a scroll listener on the search results container.

Detect when the user has scrolled within a predefined threshold (e.g., 100-200 pixels) from the bottom of the loaded results.

Trigger an API call to fetch the next page/batch of search results.

Display a loading indicator while the next set of results is being fetched.

Append the newly loaded results to the existing list.

Handle cases where there are no more results to load (e.g., hide the loading indicator and stop triggering further fetches).

Ensure performance remains smooth even with a large number of loaded items.

3.3 Filter Modal
User Story: As a user viewing search results, I want to apply filters to narrow down the results, and I expect the filter options to appear in a clear, temporary overlay.

Description: When the user taps the "Filters" button (or similar filter controls like "Price", "Brand" shown in the mockup), a modal overlay should appear, presenting available filtering options. Based on the mockup, this modal should at least include a price range filter.

Requirements:

Implement a modal component that overlays the main content when triggered.

The modal should be triggered by tapping the "Filters" button.

Include filter options relevant to the search results. Based on the mockup, a price range slider or input is required.

Provide clear controls within the modal to "Clear" filters and "View Results" (apply filters).

Clicking "View Results" should close the modal and update the search results based on the selected filters (this will require triggering a new search API call with filter parameters).

Clicking "Clear" should reset the filter selections within the modal.

The modal should be dismissible by tapping outside the modal area or via a close button (like the 'X' shown in the mockup).

The modal should be responsive and display correctly on different screen sizes.

4. Scope
   In Scope:

Implementation of the user interface based on the provided mockups.

Integration with existing or defined frontend APIs for search and filtering.

Development of the Theme Selection feature as described.

Development of the Infinite Scrolling feature for search results.

Development of the Filter Modal with basic filter options (specifically price range as shown).

Frontend validation of user interactions (e.g., filter selections).

Basic error handling for API calls (e.g., displaying a message if search fails).

Out of Scope:

Backend API development for search, filtering, or themes.

Implementation of all potential filter types (only price range is explicitly required based on the mockup).

User authentication or account management features.

Shopping cart or checkout functionality.

Detailed analytics or tracking implementation.

Accessibility features beyond basic semantic HTML/component structure (further accessibility enhancements may be considered in future iterations).

5. Design Considerations
   UI/UX: The design should prioritize ease of use and a clean, modern aesthetic consistent with the mockups. Visual feedback should be provided for user actions (e.g., loading states, button presses).

Responsiveness: While the mockups appear mobile-first, the frontend should ideally be built with responsiveness in mind to adapt to different screen sizes, even if the primary target is mobile.

Consistency: Maintain consistent styling, typography, and interaction patterns throughout the application.

6. Technical Considerations
   Frontend Framework/Library: Choose a suitable modern frontend framework/library (e.g., React, Vue, Angular) that supports component-based development and efficient state management.

State Management: Implement a robust state management solution to handle application state, including search results, filter selections, and theme preferences.

API Integration: Integrate with backend APIs for fetching search results and applying filters. Handle asynchronous operations and potential network issues gracefully.

Performance: Optimize rendering performance, especially for the potentially long list of search results with infinite scrolling. Implement techniques like virtualization if necessary for very large datasets.

Styling: Use a consistent styling approach (e.g., CSS Modules, Styled Components, Tailwind CSS) that works well with the chosen framework and supports theme switching.

7. Future Enhancements (Optional)
   More advanced filter types (categories, brand, ratings, availability, etc.).

Saving filter presets.

More theme options or custom theme creation.

Animations and transitions for a more polished feel.

Deep linking to specific search results or filter configurations.
